### 3.2 Operations Count Analysis

#### Overall Winner: **Prim's Algorithm** (6/8 cases)

| Metric | Prim's | Kruskal's | Winner |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Average Operations | 113.25 | 262.25 | **Prim's** |
| Total Operations | 906 | 2,098 | **Prim's** |

#### Detailed Comparison

| Graph ID | Vertices | Prim's Ops | Kruskal's Ops | Difference | More Efficient |
|----------|----------|------------|---------------|------------|----------------|

**Observation:** Prim's algorithm consistently performs fewer operations (approximately 2-2.5× fewer than Kruskal's), yet Kruskal's achieves faster execution time. This suggests Kruskal's operations are more lightweight (simpler comparisons in Union-Find vs priority queue operations).

### 3.3 Scalability Analysis

#### Growth Rates

| Algorithm | Time Growth | Operations Growth |
|-----------|-------------|-------------------|
| Prim's | Sub-linear to input size | Linear to vertices |
| Kruskal's | Sub-linear to input size | Linear to edges |

**Graph: Execution Time vs Graph Size**

```
Time (ms)
  0.6 |                    ●P (Graph 202)
  0.5 |                    
  0.4 |                    
  0.3 |         ●P         
  0.2 |      ●P ●P    ●P ●P
  0.1 |   ●P       ●P ●K ●K ●K ●K ●K
  0.0 +----●K-●K-------------------------
      0    10   20   30  Vertices

P = Prim's, K = Kruskal's
```

**Observation:** Kruskal's algorithm shows more consistent and predictable execution times across different graph sizes, while Prim's exhibits occasional spikes (Graph 1 and 202).

## 4. Theoretical vs Practical Comparison

### 4.1 Time Complexity (Theory)

| Algorithm | Implementation | Time Complexity | Explanation |
|-----------|----------------|-----------------|-------------|
| **Prim's** | Binary Heap (PriorityQueue) | **O(E log V)** | Each edge examined once, heap operations are O(log V) |
| **Kruskal's** | Union-Find with Path Compression | **O(E log E)** | Sorting edges + Union-Find operations |

**Simplified:**
- Prim's: O(E log V)
- Kruskal's: O(E log E) ≈ O(E log V) since E ≤ V²

**Theoretical Expectation:** Similar performance for most graphs, with Prim's potentially better for dense graphs (many edges).

### 4.2 Space Complexity (Theory)

| Algorithm | Space Complexity | Data Structures |
|-----------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Prim's** | **O(V + E)** | Visited set (V) + Priority Queue (E) + Adjacency List (V+E) |
| **Kruskal's** | **O(V + E)** | Edge list (E) + Union-Find (V) |

**Conclusion:** Both algorithms have similar space requirements.

### 4.3 Practical Performance (Results)

**Reality vs Theory:**

| Aspect | Theoretical Prediction | Actual Results |
|--------|------------------------|----------------|
| **Speed** | Similar performance | **Kruskal's 2.93× faster on average** |
| **Operations** | Should be proportional | **Prim's uses 2.32× fewer operations** |
| **Scalability** | Both scale well | **Kruskal's more consistent** |

**Why the discrepancy?**

1. **Operation Weight:** Kruskal's operations (Union-Find) are simpler than Prim's (PriorityQueue management)
2. **Cache Locality:** Kruskal's sequential edge processing is cache-friendly
3. **Overhead:** Priority queue rebalancing in Prim's adds constant-factor overhead
4. **Initial Sort:** Kruskal's upfront sorting cost is amortized well

## 5. Algorithm Characteristics

### 5.1 Prim's Algorithm

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Fewer total operations (good for operation-limited environments)
- ✅ Better for dense graphs in theory
- ✅ Can start from any vertex (flexible)
- ✅ Works well with adjacency matrix representation

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ Slower execution time in practice (priority queue overhead)
- ❌ More complex implementation
- ❌ Larger constant factors in running time
- ❌ Less predictable performance

**Best Use Cases:**
- Dense graphs where E ≈ V²
- When operation count matters more than time
- Adjacency matrix representation
- Need to start from specific vertex

### 5.2 Kruskal's Algorithm

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Faster execution time (up to 3× in our tests)
- ✅ Simpler, more elegant implementation
- ✅ More predictable performance
- ✅ Better cache locality

**Weaknesses:**
- ❌ More operations counted (Union-Find overhead)
- ❌ Requires sorting all edges upfront
- ❌ Less efficient for extremely dense graphs in theory
- ❌ Requires edge list representation

**Best Use Cases:**
- Sparse graphs (E ≈ V)
- Real-time applications (faster execution)
- When simplicity matters
- Edge list representation available

## 6. Graph Density Impact

### 6.1 Density vs Performance

| Graph Type | Density Range | Prim's Performance | Kruskal's Performance | Winner |
|------------|---------------|--------------------|-----------------------|--------|
| **Very Dense** | 0.70-0.83 | Slower (2.09 ms avg) | Faster (0.49 ms avg) | **Kruskal's** |
| **Sparse** | 0.13-0.29 | Moderate (0.25 ms avg) | Fast (0.13 ms avg) | **Kruskal's** |

**Surprising Finding:** Even on dense graphs (where Prim's should theoretically excel), Kruskal's outperforms in execution time. This contradicts theoretical expectations and highlights the importance of practical implementation factors.

### 6.2 Density Threshold Analysis

**Theoretical Break-Even Point:** Prim's should be better when E > V × log V

**Practical Observation:** In our tests, Kruskal's maintained advantage across all density levels, suggesting the break-even point (if it exists) occurs at extreme densities not tested here.

## 7. Implementation Complexity

### 7.1 Code Complexity

| Aspect | Prim's | Kruskal's | Easier |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Core Algorithm | Moderate | Simple | Kruskal's |
| Data Structures | PriorityQueue | Union-Find | Prim's |
| Edge Cases | Disconnected graphs | Disconnected graphs | Tie |
| Lines of Code | ~120 | ~150 | Prim's |
| Debugging | Moderate | Easy | Kruskal's |

**Overall:** Kruskal's is slightly easier to understand and debug despite having a custom Union-Find implementation.

### 7.2 Maintenance

**Prim's Algorithm:**
- Requires careful priority queue management
- More edge cases with queue state
- Harder to optimize further

**Kruskal's Algorithm:**
- Clean separation of concerns (sort, then union)
- Union-Find is well-studied and optimized
- Easier to parallelize (sorting step)

3. **Scalability Surprise:** Kruskal's shows exceptional consistency across graph sizes, making it more reliable for production systems

4. **Implementation Matters:** The 2-3× speed advantage for Kruskal's suggests implementation quality and modern hardware characteristics (cache, branch prediction) significantly impact performance

### 8.4 Real-World Applications

**Transportation Networks (like our assignment):**
- **Recommendation:** **Kruskal's Algorithm**
- City road networks are typically sparse (E ≈ 2V to 3V)
- Need fast computation for planning decisions
- Results validate this choice: 2.93× faster average execution

**Dense Networks (social graphs, complete networks):**
- **Recommendation:** Test both, likely **Kruskal's still wins**
- Our results suggest practical advantages override theoretical predictions

**Embedded Systems (limited resources):**
- **Recommendation:** **Prim's Algorithm**
- Fewer operations = less energy consumption
- More suitable when CPU cycles matter more than wall-clock time

### 8.5 Future Research

Potential areas for further investigation:
1. Test on extremely dense graphs (E > 0.9 × V²)
2. Parallel implementations of both algorithms
3. Hybrid approaches combining both strategies
